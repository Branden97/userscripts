## Introduction
This repository is a personal collection of userscripts created to add functionality, streamline workflows, and automate repetitive tasks on popular web platforms.

## Installation

1. **Install a Userscript Manager**

   A userscript manager is a browser extension that lets you install, manage, and run custom scripts on websites. These scripts can add new features, automate tasks, or modify the behavior of websites to better suit your needs.

   - [![Tampermonkey Logo](/.github/images/README/favicons/tampermonkey.net/favicon-16.png) &nbsp;**Tampermonkey**](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended for most browsers):

     [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is a widely-used userscript manager available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera.
